### TIDoS Framework lib/ directory:

This directory contains forks of many existing Python Packages which have been modified a bit to accurately suit the purpose of TIDoS. The following libraries have been forked and modified:

- [Scapy](https://pypi.org/project/scapy)
- [Pexpect](https://pypi.org/project/pexpect)
- [Idna](https://pypi.org/project/idna)
- [Bs4](https://pypi.org/project/bs4)
- [Tld](https://pypi.org/project/tld)
- [Shodan](https://pypi.org/project/shodan)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests)
- [Python-nmap](https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap)
- [Google](https://pypi.org/project/google)
- [Emailprotectionslib](https://pypi.org/project/emailprotectionslib)
- [Builtwith](https://pypi.org/project/builtwith)
- [Mechanize](https://pypi.org/project/mechanize)
- [DNSDumpsterAPI](https://github.com/paulsec/api-dnsdumpster.com)

[Setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools) is a non-modified version of the original package and is just a fork. 

It is these Python Packages which TIDoS needs to run.

> NOTE:
> The latest versions of TIDoS have also been made to suit the original project packages and can be installed via `pip` which makes the manual installation of TIDoS possible.
