========

This is the legacy (1.x) version of MySQLdb. While it is still being
maintained, there will not be a lot of new feature development.

TODO
----

* A bugfix 1.2.4 release
* A 1.3.0 release that will support Python 2.7-3.3
* The 2.0 version is being renamed [moist][] and is heavily refactored.

Projects
--------

* [MySQLdb-svn][]

	This is the old Subversion repository located on SourceForge.
	It has all the early historical development of MySQLdb through 1.2.3,
	and also is the working repository for ZMySQLDA. The trunk on this
	repository was forked to create the [MySQLdb2][] repository.

* [MySQLdb1][]

	This is the new (active) git repository.
	Only updates to the 1.x series will happen here.

* [MySQLdb2][]

	This is the now obsolete Mercurial repository for MySQLdb-2.0
	located on SourceForge. This repository has been migrated to the
    [moist][] repository.
