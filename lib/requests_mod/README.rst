consumption.

Behold, the power of Requests:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    u'{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}

Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your

are 100% automatic, thanks to `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 11,000,000 downloads
