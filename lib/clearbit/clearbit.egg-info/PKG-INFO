Description: # Clearbit
        
        A Python API client to [https://clearbit.com](https://clearbit.com).
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the Clearbit Python bindings, run:
        
            pip install clearbit
        
        Or
        
            easy_install clearbit
        
        ## Usage
        
        First authorize requests by setting the API key found on your [account's settings page](https://clearbit.com/keys).
        
        ```python
        import clearbit
        clearbit.key = 'mykey'
        ```
        
        You can also set the API key via the CLEARBIT_KEY environment variable.
        
        Then you can lookup people by email address. If the email's domain is corporate we'll also return a company response.
        
        ```python
        response = clearbit.Enrichment.find(email='alex@clearbit.com',stream=True)
        ```
        
        See the [documentation](https://clearbit.com/docs#person-api) for more information.
        
        ## Company lookup
        
        You can lookup company data by domain name:
        
        ```python
        company = clearbit.Company.find(domain='uber.com',stream=True)
        ```
        
        If the company can't be found, then `None` will be returned.
        
        See the [documentation](https://clearbit.com/docs#company-api) for more information.
        
        ## Testing
        
        Set the `PYTHONPATH` env var to the current directory to load the library locally:
        
            export PYTHONPATH=.
        
        ## Deploy
        
            python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
