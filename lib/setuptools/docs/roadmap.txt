Roadmap
=======

Setuptools has the following large-scale goals on the roadmap:

- Harmonize declarative config with pyproject.toml syntax.
- Deprecate and remove setup_requires and easy_install in
  favor of PEP 518 build requirements and pip install.
- Adopt the Distutils package and stop monkeypatching stdlib.
