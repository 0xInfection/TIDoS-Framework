Description: exploit (this has been modified slightly to obfuscate the url parameter). The original vulnerability was found by Renaud Lifchitz as a vulnerability in Hotmail.

Options: -safe_attrs_only
Ignore: true
Notes: I don't understand how this exploit works.  It seems like the description actually refers to
       the unicode you'd import, but why that matters I don't know.

<DIV STYLE="background-image:\0075\0072\006C\0028'\006a\0061\0076\0061\0073\0063\0072\0069\0070\0074\003a\0061\006c\0065\0072\0074\0028.1027\0058.1053\0053\0027\0029'\0029">text</div>
