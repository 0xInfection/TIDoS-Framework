Description: (this is really a hybrid of the above XSS vectors, but it really does show how hard STYLE tags can be to parse apart, like above this can send IE into a loop)
    http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html#XSS_IMG_STYLE_expression
Options: -safe_attrs_only
Notes: Modified to avoid a parsing in libxml2 that ruins the XSS (the " marks).  
       Also there seemed to be an extra "p" in exppression

<div><img style="xss: ex/*<A STYLE='no\xss:noxss(*//*);
xss:&#101;x&#x2F;*XSS*//*/*/pression(alert('XSS'))"></div>
----------
<div><img></div>
