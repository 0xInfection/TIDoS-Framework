Description: entry content contains script (cdata)
Expect: not bozo and entries[0]['content'][0]['value'] == u'safe description'
Options: 
Notes: div wrapper.  Currently not working because of how HTML() is parsing the CDATA (not in a useful way)
       The resulting code is safe, it just includes crap from the <script> tag (but not the script tag
       itself).
Ignore: true

<div>
  <![CDATA[safe<script type="text/javascript">location.href='http:/'+'/example.com/';</script> description]]>
</div>
----------
<div>safe description</div>
