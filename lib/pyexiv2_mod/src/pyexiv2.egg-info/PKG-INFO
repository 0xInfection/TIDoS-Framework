        *******
        
        Welcome to pyexiv2, a python binding to exiv2 (http://exiv2.org/), the C++
        library for manipulation of EXIF, IPTC and XMP image metadata.
        It is a python module that allows your python scripts to read and write
        metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, thumbnails) embedded in image files
        (JPEG, TIFF, ...).
        
        Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
        tag reference.
        
        
        Build dependencies
        ==================
        
        pyexiv2 depends on the following libraries:
        
         * boost.python (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
         * exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/)
        
        It uses SCons (http://www.scons.org/) as a build system.
        
        Some examples in src/ use PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/) and PyQt
        (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/) to display image previews,
        those are optional dependencies.
        
        This is a typical list of build dependencies for a Debian/Ubuntu system:
        
         * python-all-dev (≥ 2.6)
         * scons
         * libexiv2-dev (≥ 0.19)
         * libboost-python-dev (≥ 1.35)
        
        
        Building and installing
        =======================
        
        To build and install the library, while in the top-level directory
        (e.g. '~/dev/pyexiv2', which should contain a file named 'SConstruct'),
        run the following commands:
        
         $ scons
         $ scons install # as administrator, e.g. `sudo scons install`
        
        The result of the build is a dynamic library, libexiv2python.so, in the build/
        directory. This is the low-level binding. It is in turn used in a higher level
        module, pyexiv2.
        The install command installs the two modules in your site-specific directory for
        Python modules (e.g. '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/' on Linux).
        
        To use pyexiv2 in your scripts, simply import the pyexiv2 module.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Please refer to the internal documentation for a guide on how to use pyexiv2.
        In a python interpreter, type:
        
         >>> import pyexiv2
         >>> help(pyexiv2)
        
        Alternatively, you can generate HTML documentation using sphinx:
        
         $ scons doc
        
        The generated documentation can be found in doc/_build/.
