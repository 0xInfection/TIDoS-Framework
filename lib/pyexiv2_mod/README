*******

Welcome to pyexiv2, a python binding to exiv2 (http://exiv2.org/), the C++
library for manipulation of EXIF, IPTC and XMP image metadata.
It is a python module that allows your python scripts to read and write
metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, thumbnails) embedded in image files
(JPEG, TIFF, ...).

Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
tag reference.


Build dependencies
==================

pyexiv2 depends on the following libraries:

 * boost.python (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
 * exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/)

It uses SCons (http://www.scons.org/) as a build system.

Some examples in src/ use PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/) and PyQt
(http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/) to display image previews,
those are optional dependencies.

This is a typical list of build dependencies for a Debian/Ubuntu system:

 * python-all-dev (≥ 2.6)
 * scons
 * libexiv2-dev (≥ 0.19)
 * libboost-python-dev (≥ 1.35)


Building and installing
=======================

To build and install the library, while in the top-level directory
(e.g. '~/dev/pyexiv2', which should contain a file named 'SConstruct'),
run the following commands:

 $ scons
 $ scons install # as administrator, e.g. `sudo scons install`

The result of the build is a dynamic library, libexiv2python.so, in the build/
directory. This is the low-level binding. It is in turn used in a higher level
module, pyexiv2.
The install command installs the two modules in your site-specific directory for
Python modules (e.g. '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/' on Linux).

To use pyexiv2 in your scripts, simply import the pyexiv2 module.


Documentation
=============

Please refer to the internal documentation for a guide on how to use pyexiv2.
In a python interpreter, type:

 >>> import pyexiv2
 >>> help(pyexiv2)

Alternatively, you can generate HTML documentation using sphinx:

 $ scons doc

The generated documentation can be found in doc/_build/.
