It's as if the shadows are moving...
Beware. There IS someone down here.
Hide, as they are coming for you...
The darkness will swallow you whole...
Voices calling from the deep.. Can't leave.
Behind you, lurking in the shadows...
There is no going back.
Now, you face the true darkness inside of you.
You will stay down here forever, trapped and lost, like all the others before you.
The journey of apprehension has begun.
No one is going to hear you scream.
So, you have met your fate.
Making such noise in the darkness is a huge mistake that could be your downfall, since they are coming for you and are only waiting for opportunities like these, lurking in the shadows and willing to agonise.
Something is watching you.
Something is lurking among the shades, silently creeping on the floor, waiting for the eagerly anticipated moment to finally come.
There is no hope left for you. In fact, there never was.
The shadowmen are following you...
Normally, shadowmen are afraid of the light and would go away in the shine of a torch. Why doesn't it happen now?
I can't leave anymore. Can't face it.
Something in this place makes my hair stand on end.
This is all wrong. Can't go back; can't face it. Where are you?
I... I don't know what is real anymore...
